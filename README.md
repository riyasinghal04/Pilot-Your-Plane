# Pilot-Your-Plane

Our project “PILOT YOUT PLANE” is similar to an arcade style game. The goal for the user is to
go as far as possible without crash landing and try to score maximum points by passing through
hoops that come along the way. With only a few controls at one’s disposal, this is one of those
“easy to learn, difficult to master” situations.<br>
Here the user is allowed to control the movement of the plane throughout a collision course. The
plane’s movement in the four principal directions can be controlled by the up, down, left and
right arrow keys OR W,A,S,D keys. The user has to maneuver the plan using keyboard keys such
that it passes through the hoops . For every hoop passed, the score for the player will be
incremented by 1. The objective of the game is to maximise your score, and the game keeps track
of your high score throughout. Moreover,the user must make sure that no part of the plane
touches the buildings in the game environment as the game is programmed to end whenever you
crash into the surroundings.<br>
If you right click your mouse button, a drop down menu will appear. You can go to the HELP
menu to get Familiar with the game or go to the PLANE menu to customise your plane before
starting the game or while playing as well! The game allows you to exit mid-way whenever you
wish to. The library glut.h is utilized in the implementation of the game as it provides a wide
range of options to draw the necessary shapes.
